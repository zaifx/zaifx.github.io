        <p id="met1">Hi! My name is Zaif, and this is my website. I like to code and it’s the main reason I made this Website. I also like tech, especially Operating Systems with my favorite iOS, because it looks nice and has very good animations. However, I don’t really like the school system and the Education Minister as it is very bad and annoying and Ungoofaaru School is horrible. Like I feel broke there.</p>
